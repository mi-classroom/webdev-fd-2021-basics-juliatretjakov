# Personas

The interview responses were analyzed to create the following personas. They represent behaviors, attitudes, hobbies, education, and other personal characteristics that real users of the product will have and, thus, help to create a perspective through which the problem can be seen and experienced.

Creating these personas helped to understand who the users of the product are, how they behave, and what their circumstances are. They helped to visualize the people for whom I was designing and thus kept close to the user’s interest. Thinking about users’ different personalities, traits, interests, and goals allowed me to identify with them and, thus, helped me to gain empathy for them.
